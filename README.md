# Git Exercices
=============

Theses are very simple exercices to learn to manipulate git.

These are more like DIY guides to learn to handle
very common situations.

In each folder, simply run ./create.sh and follow the guide ;)

*The create script in each folder will completely reset the exercice.*  
If you want to re-read the instructions of the exercice, just cat
the file readme.txt.
